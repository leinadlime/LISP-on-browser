============================
 EDSAC Simulator on browser
============================

This is small implementation of LISP,
which written in JavaScript and run on browsers.

I think it helps you to understand what goint on in programming languages
by using it and reading its source codes.


Design
======

Readability counts.

My goal is not to make complete features of Lisp.
It makes source codes huge and makes difficult to read.


TODO
====

- Milestone1: S-expression Parser

  - given string such like "(* 1 (+ 2 3))" and return syntax trees
  - in this point forget about reader macros such as "'(1 2 3)"

- Make further milestones

License
